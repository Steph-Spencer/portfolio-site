# portfolio-site

This project is a simple website I use as my coding portfolio. It was built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

It is a work in progress.

I have some reservations about the design (my own creation), and will continue modifying it.

I need to debug the media queries, which currently take effect when the window is resized, but do not display on actual mobile devices (gah!)

I am working on adding modals that will display details about each portfolio item when the user clicks on the thumbnail.

At the moment the Portfolio section only contains two items, however when additional items are added I intend to implement either a grid or a carousel to display the items.

The intent is to add navigation to the site once I decide how I want to do it.

At a later date I will also write a gulpfile and minify the code.
